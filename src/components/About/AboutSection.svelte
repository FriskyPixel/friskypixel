    I just want to do it all! Even though my professional career has mostly
    involved video editing with some motion graphic design and 3D/CGI creation
    thrown in, I have an educational background in Computer Science and
    experience in web and software development as well.

    I am a strong believer in life-long learning and I constantly jump in on
    projects that are outside of my normal responsibilities. Although not part
    of the job description for any role I've ever had, I could be found creating
    databases for internal tracking of employee training, researching and
    testing development of 360&deg; video and VR using Unity, setting up
    customer-facing webinars, and working with the Marketing and Sales
    departments to create a variety of e-mail marketing campaigns. There's never
    a time where I don't strive to either learn something new or more fully
    master my primary job.
